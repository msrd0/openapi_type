error[E0599]: the function or associated item `schema` exists for struct `Foo<Bar>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

   | ------------- function or associated item `schema` not found for this struct because it doesn't satisfy `Foo<Bar>: OpenapiType`
...

   | ---------- doesn't satisfy `Bar: OpenapiType`

   |                 ^^^^^^ function or associated item cannot be called on `Foo<Bar>` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
   |
   = note: trait bound `Bar: OpenapiType` was not satisfied
   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `Foo<Bar>: OpenapiType`
           which is required by `&Foo<Bar>: OpenapiType`
note: the trait `OpenapiType` must be implemented
  --> src/lib.rs

   | pub trait OpenapiType {
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `schema`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `OpenapiType`
