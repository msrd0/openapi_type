error[E0599]: the function or associated item `schema` exists for struct `Foo<Bar>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

    | -------------

    |                 ^^^^^^ function or associated item cannot be called on `Foo<Bar>` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
    |
note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied because of the requirements of the implementation of `OpenapiType` for `_`:
      `Bar: OpenapiType`
      `Foo<Bar>: OpenapiType`

note: the following trait must be implemented

    = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
    = note: the following trait defines an item `schema`, perhaps you need to implement it:
            candidate #1: `OpenapiType`
    = note: this error originates in the derive macro `OpenapiType` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
