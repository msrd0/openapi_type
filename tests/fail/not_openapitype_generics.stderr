error[E0599]: the function or associated item `schema` exists for struct `Foo<Bar>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

   |                 ^^^^^^ function or associated item cannot be called on `Foo<Bar>` due to unsatisfied trait bounds

   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `Bar: OpenapiType`
           which is required by `Foo<Bar>: OpenapiType`
           `Foo<Bar>: OpenapiType`
           which is required by `&Foo<Bar>: OpenapiType`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `schema`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `OpenapiType`
